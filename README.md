# Welcome stranger

I am Robin (or Rob) and on this profile you will find all kinds of different projects. Take a look around!
My main interests lie in Graphics/GameEngine Programming (especially using the Vulkan API), Operating System development as well as Software Security Testing.

## Some projects I am particularly proud of

- [vulkan-engine](https://github.com/michidk/vulkan-engine): A game engine fully written in Rust using the Vulkan API
- [SimpleOS2](https://github.com/rob2309/SimpleOS2): A not-so-simple Operating System for x64 written in C++
- [SimpleOS-rs](https://github.com/rob2309/SimpleOS-rs): A rust port of my SimpleOS2, currently in very early stages of development
- [spirv-layout](https://github.com/rob2309/spirv-layout): A SPIR-V reflection library written in Rust
